# plate_analysis_3d
FEM analysis of plate structure and .obj export module

What the project does?

This is the Program to calculate 3 nodes Plate Structure using Matrix Analysis Method. By giving input data of plate structures, loads and restrains, The program will form the structure stiffness matrix and will calculate deformations of the structure and strain energy. It also have export module which will export structure in .obj format. 

How users can get started with the project?

The repository includes 3 parts

FEM_triplate.py
triplate_GEN.py
plate_example.py
Users can create input data of plate structures, loads and restrains in "plate_example.py".
